<h1>Game Features and How to Play</h1>
<h2>ðŸ‘€ You will see</h2>
<p>A grid of 20x20 default size, with a total of 400 cells.</p>
<p>There are 5% of cells are alive randomly, filled with black color.</p>

<h2>âœ¨ You can</h2>
<p>Hit the <mark>Next</mark> button to evolve the pattern made up by alive cells, followed by the universe of the Game of Life. </p>

<h2>âœ¨ If you want to change the size of the grid</h2>
<p>Enter the number of row and column you want and hit the <mark>Update Grid</mark> button (or hit return/enter from your keyboard) to get a new grid with the size you want. </p>
<p><em>Note that</em> you are only allowed to enter numbers from <u>3</u> to <u>40</u>. Anything beyond that will result in the grid remaining the same size and an error message. If you enter any out-of-range numbers, you can start to pray it wonâ€™t be a <del>window alert</del>. Just kidding, we are not that evil! </p>

<h2>âœ¨ If you want to reset the alive cells </h2>
<p>Hit that <mark>Reset</mark> button! </p>

<h2>âœ¨ If you want some cells alive or dead</h2>
<p>Click on that cell, it will reverse the state. </p>

<h2>âœ¨ If you want to keep tracks of the cells thatâ€™s dead</h2>
<p>We have a heatmap feature that allows you to see the dead cells with different shades of blue indicating how long they have been dead. </p>
<p>You can use this feature by turning on the <mark>Heatmap switch</mark>. The switch is located at the bottom. </p>

<h2>âœ¨ If you are too lazy to hit Next button </h2>
<p>We have Auto Play feature to free up your hands. </p>
<p>Hit that <mark>Auto Play</mark> button, and the cells in the grid will evolve automatically every 100 milliseconds. </p>
